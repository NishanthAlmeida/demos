# TO DO:

* start with the image zoomed to the middle, not the top-left
* update the description talking about alignment options of SC.ScrollView,
 care taken to scale to the center, etc.
* loading messages for images that are slow to load.
* more pizzaz!
** zoom to fit, zoom +, zoom - to replace scale slider?
** click to zoom?
** more styling?
